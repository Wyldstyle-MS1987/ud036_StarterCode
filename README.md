Steps to create a Movie Trailer website:
1) Download media.py, entertainment_center.py and fresh_tomatoes.py. 
2) Save the three files in the same folder.
3) Run entertainment_center.py in a python IDE.

Your default brower will open up a HTML file that displays six movies. Click on anyone of them, it will play the youtube movie trailer    of that movie.
